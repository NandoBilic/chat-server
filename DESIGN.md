Using a single char* per chat simplifies the storage structure. Since each chat is just a string containing all its data, managing the list of chats becomes straightforward. This simplicity can reduce the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults because there are fewer pointers to manage and less dynamic memory allocation overall. However, storing all chat data in a single concatenated string means losing the ability to easily access and manipulate individual components of a chat. Operations that require modifying or accessing specific fields becomes a arithmatic nightmare because the data is unstructured within the string. 

The edit feature would be signifigantly harder to implement having to parse through the chat string to find your current message and if the string sizes are not the same size (most of the time) you will have a problem. You would have to entire new chats which woul be error prone and waste of preformance.
